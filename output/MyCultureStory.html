<h2 id="1-intro">1. Intro<a class="headerlink" href="#1-intro" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In this page, I just casually write down what I am thinking of.</p>
<h3 id="11-name">1.1 Name<a class="headerlink" href="#11-name" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Scarb" src="http://114.215.140.250/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/scarb-1.png" />
My name is Henry Jin, my Chinese name is ”金嘉浩“. I have a English nickname called "Scarb".
The name "Henry" can be traced back to my primary school, the teacher in Children's Palace gave me this English name.
The name "Scarb" I mostly used it on the Internet. 
It is a modified version of the word "scarab", which is my Chinese nickname.</p>
<h3 id="12-from">1.2 From<a class="headerlink" href="#12-from" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><img alt="HangZhou" src="http://114.215.140.250/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/hangzhou-1.jpg" />
I come from HangZhou. Yeah, I'm a native. But I don't know HangZhou very well, cause my range of activity is small, just around my home and school.</p>
<h3 id="13-major">1.3 Major<a class="headerlink" href="#13-major" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>I major in Computer Science, which is called a major of programmer. I decided to be a programmer so I choiced this major.</p>
<h3 id="14-sex">1.4 Sex<a class="headerlink" href="#14-sex" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Of course I am a male, a residential male. That's why my </p>
<h3 id="15-age">1.5 Age<a class="headerlink" href="#15-age" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>I'm approximately 20 years old. I'm now in my best period of time in my life.</p>
<h2 id="2-games">2. Games<a class="headerlink" href="#2-games" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>I think my cultural story can be concentrating into two words: computer and games. In a word, computer games.
When I was a child, I developed a liking for computer games. 
On the beginning, I am a game player. And I gradually turnning my self into a game maker.</p>
<h3 id="21-starcraft">2.1 StarCraft<a class="headerlink" href="#21-starcraft" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><img alt="StarCraft" src="http://114.215.140.250/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/starcraft-1.jpg" />
On my first grade of primary school, my classmate lent me a game disk, which contains StarCraft.
In summer holidaies, I played it a lot. This is the first contact with Billard games.</p>
<h3 id="22-warcraft">2.2 WarCraft<a class="headerlink" href="#22-warcraft" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><img alt="WarCraft" src="http://114.215.140.250/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/warcraft.jpg" />
When I was about to graduate from primary school, WarCraft was porpular all over the country.
Played it for sometimes, like I played Starcraft, I still could't beat the computer.
So I turn to play some RPG('Role Play Games') in WarCraft.
Once I had a brilliant idea, remake a StarCraft map into WarCraftIII. 
I did make the map after much effort, and it quickly became very popular.
This is my first success as a game maker.</p>
<h3 id="23-blizzard">2.3 Blizzard<a class="headerlink" href="#23-blizzard" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Blizzard" src="http://114.215.140.250/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/blizzard.jpg" />
After that, I played World of WarCraft, StarCraftII, Hearthstone, Diablo...... almost all of Blizzard games.
I'm totally impressed by Blizzard and those great games and I became a fan of Blizzard.</p>
<h3 id="24-starcraftii">2.4 StarCraftII<a class="headerlink" href="#24-starcraftii" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><img alt="StarCraftII" src="http://114.215.140.250/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/starcraftii.jpg" />
This is the game I play it until now. It is my favorite game. I've been playing it for years and reached a high level.
As a sequel of StarCraft, SC2('StarCraftII') has a much better quality.
When playing the game, you must one hundrad percent concentrate on it, or you will be defeated quickly.
This time, I still made some success on map making. One of my map is still the seconed popular map over the country.
Because of the success I made in map making, I decided to become a game maker in the future. This was in my senior high school.
My final goal, is to establish a game company like Blizzard. 
This is my dream.
I know it is very far from me, but I just chasing it, step by step.</p>
<h3 id="25-moblie-game">2.5 Moblie Game<a class="headerlink" href="#25-moblie-game" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>When I got into college, I wanted to make some independent games. So I choiced mobile games.
I am still groping on this path, which is harder to walk.</p>
<h2 id="3-character">3. Character<a class="headerlink" href="#3-character" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="31-enterprise">3.1 Enterprise<a class="headerlink" href="#31-enterprise" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This is a word I like. It comes from a movie Star Trek. In the movie, it is the name of a spaceship.
I'd like to get closer to my dream, so I am enterprise. I cannot bear leisure or sit around.
I want every day is fruitfull. But sometimes, I am lazy.
It seems like I am a kind of utilitarian, but I think it is good to do the best of what I can.</p>
<h3 id="32-introversion">3.2 Introversion<a class="headerlink" href="#32-introversion" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>I'm a introverted guy. 
Programmers are mostly introverted person.
I can spend a day even without saying one word.
As time passes, I am ashamed of talk to strangers.
I'm quiet and calm, probably good at listening and observing.
I am always keep a low profile, I hate "zhuangB" which means showing off in front of public.</p>
<h3 id="33-willful">3.3 Willful<a class="headerlink" href="#33-willful" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Or it can be called have good execution.
I always do what I want to do. For example, it I start a project, nothing can stop me unitil I finally work it out.
When I want to buy something, I will buy it without doubt, when I don't want to having class, I won't go.
Because I know what is important for me and I believe I am right.
In some cases, I have OCD('Obsessive-compulsive disorder'), but I think it helps me to finish things better.
When I get into trouble, I try my best to work it out, and I success in most of the time.</p>
<h3 id="34-unconventional">3.4 Unconventional<a class="headerlink" href="#34-unconventional" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>I indifference to traditional culture.
After last English class, I realized in many situations I match westerners' behavior.
For example, I'm partly a individualist.
I hate stereotypes, so I do not follow the custom.</p>
<h2 id="4-hobby">4. Hobby<a class="headerlink" href="#4-hobby" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="41-starcraftii">4.1 StarCraftII<a class="headerlink" href="#41-starcraftii" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>StarCraftII, of course, is my hobby. I made a great achievement on this game.
When playing it, I will feel sober. So it is a game whick refresh my mind.</p>
<h3 id="42-basketball">4.2 Basketball<a class="headerlink" href="#42-basketball" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><img alt="NBA" src="http://114.215.140.250/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NBA.jpg" />
I played basketball a lot in middle school. But now, almost one year has passed since I last playd baskedball.
Although I haven't play basketball for a long time, I positively regard NBA('National Basketball Association') games.
NBA is also a part of my life.</p>
<h3 id="43-english">4.3 English<a class="headerlink" href="#43-english" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Why English? I don't know either. I just come up with it. Maybe I write it just for please you.
I don't like learning English in school, in classroom.
But I think English is cool.
I changed my system into English, and I watch videos with English subtitles. It's cool, isn't it?
As a programmer, it is very important to learn English well. Only after that can I read documents in English.</p>
<h3 id="44-coding">4.4 Coding<a class="headerlink" href="#44-coding" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><img alt="Coding" src="http://114.215.140.250/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/coding.png" />
I almost forget it. Coding is my hobby. I am very glad to make my hobby into an occupation.
People may think coding is tired and boring. But for me it's very cool, so I rarely get bored when typing codes.
I'd like first to become a game programmer, then pursue breakthroughs in my life.</p>
