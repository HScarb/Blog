# Unity3D 播放视频文件

[TOC]

新版本的Unity废弃了`MovieTexture`，改用`VideoPlayer`播放视频，用`VideoClip`存视频。
相较以前方便了许多。

`VideoPlayer`可以指定两种不同类型的`VideoSource`:
1. `VideoClip`类型，需要将视频先导入到Unity转换成`VideoClip`类型
1. `URL`，可以根据路径直接播放本地视频或者是网上的视频

>Content can be either a VideoClip imported asset or a URL such as file:// or http://. Video content will be projected onto one of the supported targets, such as camera background or RenderTexture. If the video content includes transparency, this transparency will be present in the target, allowing objects behind the video target to be visible.

视频的格式需要符合一定的要求，简单说视频需要`H264`编码，音频`AAC`。

>The VideoPlayer uses native audio and video decoding libraries in its implementation and it is your responsibility to use videos that match the requirements for the target platform. The VideoClipImporter offers an option to transcode the VideoClip assets into one of H.264 or VP8 video codecs, along with a few options to experiment with, such as resolution. This uses the matching codec for audio tracks: AAC and Vorbis respectively.

## Main Camera 中播放视频

~~~Csharp
// Examples of VideoPlayer function

using UnityEngine;

public class Example : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Will attach a VideoPlayer to the main camera.
        GameObject camera = GameObject.Find("Main Camera");

        // VideoPlayer automatically targets the camera backplane when it is added
        // to a camera object, no need to change videoPlayer.targetCamera.
        var videoPlayer = camera.AddComponent<UnityEngine.Video.VideoPlayer>();

        // By default, VideoPlayers added to a camera will use the far plane.
        // Let's target the near plane instead.
        videoPlayer.renderMode = UnityEngine.Video.VideoRenderMode.CameraNearPlane;

        // This will cause our scene to be visible through the video being played.
        videoPlayer.targetCameraAlpha = 0.5F;

        // Set the video to play. URL supports local absolute or relative paths.
        // Here, using absolute.
        videoPlayer.url = "/Users/graham/movie.mov";

        // Skip the first 100 frames.
        videoPlayer.frame = 100;

        // Restart from beginning when done.
        videoPlayer.isLooping = true;

        // Each time we reach the end, we slow down the playback by a factor of 10.
        videoPlayer.loopPointReached += EndReached;

        // Start playback. This means the VideoPlayer may have to prepare (reserve
        // resources, pre-load a few frames, etc.). To better control the delays
        // associated with this preparation one can use videoPlayer.Prepare() along with
        // its prepareCompleted event.
        videoPlayer.Play();
    }

    void EndReached(UnityEngine.Video.VideoPlayer vp)
    {
        vp.playbackSpeed = vp.playbackSpeed / 10.0F;
    }
}

## Raw Image 中播放视频

在场景中创建一个RawImage，添加以下代码

~~~Csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using UnityEngine.Video;

public class StreamVideo : MonoBehaviour {

    public RawImage image;

    public VideoClip videoToPlay;

    private VideoPlayer videoPlayer;
    private VideoSource videoSource;

    private AudioSource audioSource;
	
    // Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
        Application.runInBackground = true;
        StartCoroutine(playVideo());
	}

    IEnumerator playVideo()
    {
      
        //Add VideoPlayer to the GameObject
        videoPlayer = gameObject.AddComponent<VideoPlayer>();

        //Add AudioSource
        audioSource = gameObject.AddComponent<AudioSource>();

        //Disable Play on Awake for both Video and Audio
        videoPlayer.playOnAwake = false;
        audioSource.playOnAwake = false;
        audioSource.Pause();

        //We want to play from video clip not from url
        
        videoPlayer.source = VideoSource.VideoClip;

        // Vide clip from Url
        //videoPlayer.source = VideoSource.Url;
        //videoPlayer.url = "http://www.quirksmode.org/html5/videos/big_buck_bunny.mp4";


        //Set Audio Output to AudioSource
        videoPlayer.audioOutputMode = VideoAudioOutputMode.AudioSource;

        //Assign the Audio from Video to AudioSource to be played
        videoPlayer.EnableAudioTrack(0, true);
        videoPlayer.SetTargetAudioSource(0, audioSource);

        //Set video To Play then prepare Audio to prevent Buffering
        videoPlayer.clip = videoToPlay;
        videoPlayer.Prepare();

        //Wait until video is prepared
        while (!videoPlayer.isPrepared)
        {
            yield return null;
        }

        Debug.Log("Done Preparing Video");

        //Assign the Texture from Video to RawImage to be displayed
        image.texture = videoPlayer.texture;

        //Play Video
        videoPlayer.Play();

        //Play Sound
        audioSource.Play();

        Debug.Log("Playing Video");
        while (videoPlayer.isPlaying)
        {
            Debug.LogWarning("Video Time: " + Mathf.FloorToInt((float)videoPlayer.time));
            yield return null;
        }

        Debug.Log("Done Playing Video");
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update () {
		
	}
}
