# Scarb's cultural story
## 1. Intro
In this page, I just casually write down what I am thinking of.

### 1.1 Name
![Scarb][img1]
My name is Henry Jin, my Chinese name is ”金嘉浩“. I have a English nickname called "Scarb".
The name "Henry" can be traced back to my primary school, the teacher in Children's Palace gave me this English name.
The name "Scarb" I mostly used it on the Internet. 
It is a modified version of the word "scarab", which is my Chinese nickname.

### 1.2 From
![HangZhou][img2]
I come from HangZhou. Yeah, I'm a native. But I don't know HangZhou very well, cause my range of activity is small, just around my home and school.

### 1.3 Major
I major in Computer Science, which is called a major of programmer. I decided to be a programmer so I choiced this major.

### 1.4 Sex
Of course I am a male, a residential male. That's why my 

### 1.5 Age
I'm approximately 20 years old. I'm now in my best period of time in my life.

## 2. Games
I think my cultural story can be concentrating into two words: computer and games. In a word, computer games.
When I was a child, I developed a liking for computer games. 
On the beginning, I am a game player. And I gradually turnning my self into a game maker.

### 2.1 StarCraft
![StarCraft][img3]
On my first grade of primary school, my classmate lent me a game disk, which contains StarCraft.
In summer holidaies, I played it a lot. This is the first contact with Billard games.

### 2.2 WarCraft
![WarCraft][img4]
When I was about to graduate from primary school, WarCraft was porpular all over the country.
Played it for sometimes, like I played Starcraft, I still could't beat the computer.
So I turn to play some RPG('Role Play Games') in WarCraft.
Once I had a brilliant idea, remake a StarCraft map into WarCraftIII. 
I did make the map after much effort, and it quickly became very popular.
This is my first success as a game maker.

### 2.3 Blizzard
![Blizzard][img5]
After that, I played World of WarCraft, StarCraftII, Hearthstone, Diablo...... almost all of Blizzard games.
I'm totally impressed by Blizzard and those great games and I became a fan of Blizzard.

### 2.4 StarCraftII
![StarCraftII][img6]
This is the game I play it until now. It is my favorite game. I've been playing it for years and reached a high level.
As a sequel of StarCraft, SC2('StarCraftII') has a much better quality.
When playing the game, you must one hundrad percent concentrate on it, or you will be defeated quickly.
This time, I still made some success on map making. One of my map is still the seconed popular map over the country.
Because of the success I made in map making, I decided to become a game maker in the future. This was in my senior high school.
My final goal, is to establish a game company like Blizzard. 
This is my dream.
I know it is very far from me, but I just chasing it, step by step.

### 2.5 Moblie Game
When I got into college, I wanted to make some independent games. So I choiced mobile games.
I am still groping on this path, which is harder to walk.

## 3. Character
### 3.1 Enterprise
This is a word I like. It comes from a movie Star Trek. In the movie, it is the name of a spaceship.
I'd like to get closer to my dream, so I am enterprise. I cannot bear leisure or sit around.
I want every day is fruitfull. But sometimes, I am lazy.
It seems like I am a kind of utilitarian, but I think it is good to do the best of what I can.

### 3.2 Introversion
I'm a introverted guy. 
Programmers are mostly introverted person.
I can spend a day even without saying one word.
As time passes, I am ashamed of talk to strangers.
I'm quiet and calm, probably good at listening and observing.
I am always keep a low profile, I hate "zhuangB" which means showing off in front of public.

### 3.3 Willful
Or it can be called have good execution.
I always do what I want to do. For example, it I start a project, nothing can stop me unitil I finally work it out.
When I want to buy something, I will buy it without doubt, when I don't want to having class, I won't go.
Because I know what is important for me and I believe I am right.
In some cases, I have OCD('Obsessive-compulsive disorder'), but I think it helps me to finish things better.
When I get into trouble, I try my best to work it out, and I success in most of the time.

### 3.4 Unconventional
I indifference to traditional culture.
After last English class, I realized in many situations I match westerners' behavior.
For example, I'm partly a individualist.
I hate stereotypes, so I do not follow the custom.


## 4. Hobby
### 4.1 StarCraftII
StarCraftII, of course, is my hobby. I made a great achievement on this game.
When playing it, I will feel sober. So it is a game whick refresh my mind.

### 4.2 Basketball
![NBA][img7]
I played basketball a lot in middle school. But now, almost one year has passed since I last playd baskedball.
Although I haven't play basketball for a long time, I positively regard NBA('National Basketball Association') games.
NBA is also a part of my life.

### 4.3 English
Why English? I don't know either. I just come up with it. Maybe I write it just for please you.
I don't like learning English in school, in classroom.
But I think English is cool.
I changed my system into English, and I watch videos with English subtitles. It's cool, isn't it?
As a programmer, it is very important to learn English well. Only after that can I read documents in English.

### 4.4 Coding
![Coding][img8]
I almost forget it. Coding is my hobby. I am very glad to make my hobby into an occupation.
People may think coding is tired and boring. But for me it's very cool, so I rarely get bored when typing codes.
I'd like first to become a game programmer, then pursue breakthroughs in my life.
