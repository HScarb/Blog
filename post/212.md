## 问题描述

There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, 
so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.
```
Note:
>N is in range [1,200].
>M[i][i] = 1 for all students.
>If M[i][j] = 1, then M[j][i] = 1.

## 解题思路
题意是给出一个朋友关系的矩阵，要找出朋友圈的数量。
直接使用并查集处理即可。

## 参考代码
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class UF
{
private:
	int * id;
	int * sz;
	int count;

public:
	UF(int N)
	{
		id = new int[N];
		sz = new int[N];
		count = N;
		for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
		{
			id[i] = i;
			sz[i] = 1;
		}
	}
	~UF()
	{
		delete[] id;
		delete[] sz;
	}
	int getCount()
	{
		return count;
	}
	int find(int i)
	{
		while (id[i] != i)
		{
			id[i] = id[id[i]];
			i = id[i];
		}
		return i;
	}
	bool connected(int p, int q)
	{
		return find(p) == find(q);
	}
	void connect(int p, int q)
	{
		int a = find(p);
		int b = find(q);
		if (a == b) return;
		if(sz[a] < sz[b])
		{
			id[a] = b;
			sz[b] += sz[a];
		}
		else
		{
			id[b] = a;
			sz[a] += sz[b];
		}
		count--;
	}
};

class Solution {
public:
	int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& M) {
		if (M.size() == 0)return 0;
		if (M.size() == 1) return 1;

		UF uf = UF(M.size());
		for (int i = 0; i < M.size(); ++i)
		{
			for (int j = 0; j < M.size(); ++j)
			{
				if (i < j)
					if (M[i][j] == 1)
						uf.connect(i, j);
			}
		}
		return uf.getCount();
	}
};

int main()
{
	vector<vector<int>> M = { {1,1,0}, {1,1,0}, {0,0,1} };
	auto sl = new Solution();
	cout << sl->findCircleNum(M) << endl;

	system("pause");
	return 0;
}
```
