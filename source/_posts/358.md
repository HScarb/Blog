### ReentrantLock可重入锁 互斥锁/排他锁

* `Lock`接口的实现
* 可重入
* 公平锁`new ReentrantLock(true)	`

#### 与`synchronized`的区别

- A synchronized block makes no guarantees about the sequence in which threads waiting to entering it are granted access.
- You cannot pass any parameters to the entry of a synchronized block. Thus, having a timeout trying to get access to a synchronized block is not possible.
- The synchronized block must be fully contained within a single method. A `Lock` can have it's calls to `lock()` and `unlock()` in separate methods.

#### 主要方法

- lock()：申请锁，锁定对象为`Lock`实例
- lockInterruptibly()：申请锁，可以被`interrupt()`打断
- tryLock()
- tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit timeUnit)
- unlock()

The `lock()` method locks the `Lock` instance if possible. If the `Lock` instance is already locked, the thread calling `lock()` is blocked until the `Lock` is unlocked.

The `lockInterruptibly()` method locks the `Lock` unless the thread calling the method has been interrupted. Additionally, if a thread is blocked waiting to lock the `Lock` via this method, and it is interrupted, it exits this method calls.

The `tryLock()` method attempts to lock the `Lock` instance immediately. It returns `true` if the locking succeeds, false if `Lock` is already locked. This method never blocks.

The `tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit timeUnit)` works like the `tryLock()` method, except it waits up the given timeout before giving up trying to lock the `Lock`.

The `unlock()` method unlocks the `Lock` instance. Typically, a `Lock` implementation will only allow the thread that has locked the `Lock` to call this method. Other threads calling this method may result in an unchecked exception (`RuntimeException`).

### ReadWriteLock 共享锁

高级接口，允许多个线程读同一个资源，但是每次只允许一个线程写入该资源。

规则如下

* ReadLock：允许其他读线程申请锁，不允许写线程申请

  * If no threads have locked the `ReadWriteLock` for writing, and no thread have requested a write lock (but not yet obtained it). 
    Thus, multiple threads can lock the lock for reading.
* WriteLock
  * If no threads are reading or writing. 
    Thus, only one thread at a time can lock the lock for writing.

实现

* ReentrantReadWriteLock

```java
    static Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private static int value;

    static ReadWriteLock readWriteLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    static Lock readLock = readWriteLock.readLock();
    static Lock writeLock = readWriteLock.writeLock();

    public static void read(Lock lock) {
        try {
            lock.lock();
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            System.out.println("read over!");
            //模拟读取操作
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public static void write(Lock lock, int v) {
        try {
            lock.lock();
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            value = v;
            System.out.println("write over!");
            //模拟写操作
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Runnable readR = ()-> read(lock);
        Runnable readR = ()-> read(readLock);

        //Runnable writeR = ()->write(lock, new Random().nextInt());
        Runnable writeR = ()->write(writeLock, new Random().nextInt());

        for(int i = 0; i < 18; i++) new Thread(readR).start();
        for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) new Thread(writeR).start();
    }
```

### CountDownLatch[^CountDownLatch]

A `java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch` is a concurrency construct that allows one or more threads to wait for a given set of operations to complete.

A `CountDownLatch` is initialized with a given count. This count is decremented by calls to the `countDown()` method. Threads waiting for this count to reach zero can call one of the `await()` methods. Calling `await()` blocks the thread until the count reaches zero.

Below is a simple example. After the `Decrementer` has called `countDown()` 3 times on the `CountDownLatch`, the waiting `Waiter` is released from the `await()` call.

```java
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

Waiter      waiter      = new Waiter(latch);
Decrementer decrementer = new Decrementer(latch);

new Thread(waiter)     .start();
new Thread(decrementer).start();

Thread.sleep(4000);
```

```java
public class Waiter implements Runnable{

    CountDownLatch latch = null;

    public Waiter(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    public void run() {
        try {
            latch.await();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Waiter Released");
    }
}
```

```java
public class Decrementer implements Runnable {

    CountDownLatch latch = null;

    public Decrementer(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    public void run() {

        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            this.latch.countDown();

            Thread.sleep(1000);
            this.latch.countDown();

            Thread.sleep(1000);
            this.latch.countDown();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### CyclicBarrier[^CyclicBarrier]

It is a barrier that all threads must wait at, until all threads reach it, before any of the threads can continue. 

![Two threads waiting for each other at CyclicBarriers.](https://images.gitee.com/uploads/images/2020/0424/105147_0529d556_1333254.png)

The threads wait for each other by calling the `await()` method on the `CyclicBarrier`. Once N threads are waiting at the `CyclicBarrier`, all threads are released and can continue running.

#### Creating a CyclicBarrier

When you create a `CyclicBarrier` you specify how many threads are to wait at it, before releasing them. Here is how you create a `CyclicBarrier`:

```java
CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(2);
```

#### Waiting at a CyclicBarrier

Here is how a thread waits at a `CyclicBarrier`:

```java
barrier.await();
```

You can also specify a timeout for the waiting thread. When the timeout has passed the thread is also released, even if not all N threads are waiting at the `CyclicBarrier`. Here is how you specify a timeout:

```java
barrier.await(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

The waiting threads waits at the `CyclicBarrier` until either:

- The last thread arrives (calls await() )
- The thread is interrupted by another thread (another thread calls its interrupt() method)
- Another waiting thread is interrupted
- Another waiting thread times out while waiting at the `CyclicBarrier`
- The `CyclicBarrier.reset()` method is called by some external thread.

#### CyclicBarrier Action

The `CyclicBarrier` supports a barrier action, which is a `Runnable` that is executed once the last thread arrives. You pass the `Runnable` barrier action to the `CyclicBarrier` in its constructor, like this:

```java
Runnable      barrierAction = ... ;
CyclicBarrier barrier       = new CyclicBarrier(2, barrierAction);
```

#### CyclicBarrier Example

Here is a code example that shows you how to use a `CyclicBarrier`:

```java
Runnable barrier1Action = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("BarrierAction 1 executed ");
    }
};
Runnable barrier2Action = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("BarrierAction 2 executed ");
    }
};

CyclicBarrier barrier1 = new CyclicBarrier(2, barrier1Action);
CyclicBarrier barrier2 = new CyclicBarrier(2, barrier2Action);

CyclicBarrierRunnable barrierRunnable1 =
        new CyclicBarrierRunnable(barrier1, barrier2);

CyclicBarrierRunnable barrierRunnable2 =
        new CyclicBarrierRunnable(barrier1, barrier2);

new Thread(barrierRunnable1).start();
new Thread(barrierRunnable2).start();
```

Here is the `CyclicBarrierRunnable` class:

```java
public class CyclicBarrierRunnable implements Runnable{

    CyclicBarrier barrier1 = null;
    CyclicBarrier barrier2 = null;

    public CyclicBarrierRunnable(
            CyclicBarrier barrier1,
            CyclicBarrier barrier2) {

        this.barrier1 = barrier1;
        this.barrier2 = barrier2;
    }

    public void run() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +
                                " waiting at barrier 1");
            this.barrier1.await();

            Thread.sleep(1000);
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +
                                " waiting at barrier 2");
            this.barrier2.await();

            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() +
                                " done!");

        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } catch (BrokenBarrierException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Here is the console output for an execution of the above code. Note that the sequence in which the threads gets to write to the console may vary from execution to execution. Sometimes `Thread-0` prints first, sometimes `Thread-1` prints first etc.

```java
Thread-0 waiting at barrier 1
Thread-1 waiting at barrier 1
BarrierAction 1 executed
Thread-1 waiting at barrier 2
Thread-0 waiting at barrier 2
BarrierAction 2 executed
Thread-0 done!
Thread-1 done!
```

### Phaser

```java
public class T09_TestPhaser2 {
    static Random r = new Random();
    static MarriagePhaser phaser = new MarriagePhaser();

    static void milliSleep(int milli) {
        try {
            TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(milli);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        phaser.bulkRegister(7);

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            new Thread(new Person("p" + i)).start();
        }
        new Thread(new Person("新郎")).start();
        new Thread(new Person("新娘")).start();
    }

    static class MarriagePhaser extends Phaser {
        @Override
        protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
            switch (phase) {
                case 0:
                    System.out.println("所有人到齐了！" + registeredParties);
                    System.out.println();
                    return false;
                case 1:
                    System.out.println("所有人吃完了！" + registeredParties);
                    System.out.println();
                    return false;
                case 2:
                    System.out.println("所有人离开了！" + registeredParties);
                    System.out.println();
                    return false;
                case 3:
                    System.out.println("婚礼结束！新郎新娘抱抱！" + registeredParties);
                    return true;
                default:
                    return true;
            }
        }
    }

    static class Person implements Runnable {
        String name;

        public Person(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        public void arrive() {
            milliSleep(r.nextInt(1000));
            System.out.printf("%s 到达现场！\n", name);
            phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
        }

        public void eat() {

            phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
        }

        public void leave() {

                phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
            } else {
                phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
                //phaser.register()
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            arrive();
            eat();

### Exchanger

The `java.util.concurrent.Exchanger` class represents a kind of rendezvous point where two threads can exchange objects. Here is an illustration of this mechanism:

 ![Two threads exchanging objects via an Exchanger.](https://images.gitee.com/uploads/images/2020/0424/105147_0396b0cc_1333254.png)

Exchanging objects is done via one of the two `exchange()` methods. Here is an example:

```java
Exchanger exchanger = new Exchanger();

ExchangerRunnable exchangerRunnable1 =
        new ExchangerRunnable(exchanger, "A");

ExchangerRunnable exchangerRunnable2 =
        new ExchangerRunnable(exchanger, "B");

new Thread(exchangerRunnable1).start();
new Thread(exchangerRunnable2).start();
```

Here is the `ExchangerRunnable` code:

```java
public class ExchangerRunnable implements Runnable{

    Exchanger exchanger = null;
    Object    object    = null;

    public ExchangerRunnable(Exchanger exchanger, Object object) {
        this.exchanger = exchanger;
        this.object = object;
    }

    public void run() {
        try {
            Object previous = this.object;

            this.object = this.exchanger.exchange(this.object);

            System.out.println(
                    Thread.currentThread().getName() +
                    " exchanged " + previous + " for " + this.object
            );
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This example prints out this:

```
Thread-0 exchanged A for B
Thread-1 exchanged B for A
```

### Semaphore

```java
Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(permits, fair);
```

- acquire()
- release()

The counting semaphore is initialized with a given number of "permits". For each call to `acquire()` a permit is taken by the calling thread. For each call to `release()` a permit is returned to the semaphore. Thus, at most N threads can pass the `acquire()` method without any `release()` calls, where N is the number of permits the semaphore was initialized with. The permits are just a simple counter. Nothing fancy here.

#### Semaphore作用

1. To guard a critical section against entry by more than N threads at a time. （限流，最多允许N个线程同时运行一段代码）
2. To send signals between two threads. （线程间信号传递）

### Sending Signals Between Threads

If you use a semaphore to send signals between threads, then you would typically have one thread call the `acquire()` method, and the other thread to call the `release()` method.

If no permits are available, the `acquire()` call will block until a permit is released by another thread. Similarly, a `release()` calls is blocked if no more permits can be released into this semaphore.

Thus it is possible to coordinate threads. For instance, if acquire was called after Thread 1 had inserted an object in a shared list, and Thread 2 had called `release()` just before taking an object from that list, you had essentially created a blocking queue. The number of permits available in the semaphore would correspond to the maximum number of elements the blocking queue could hold.

```java
public class MyQueue<E> {
    Semaphore s = new Semaphore(0, true);
    private Queue<E> queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();

    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return this.queue.isEmpty();
    }

    public void enqueue(E e) {
        queue.add(e);
        s.release();
    }

    public E dequeue() {
        E e;
        try {
            s.acquire();
        } catch (InterruptedException e1) {
            e1.printStackTrace();
        }
        e = queue.remove();
        return e;
    }
}
```

#### Fairness

No guarantees are made about [fairness](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/starvation-and-fairness.html) of the threads acquiring permits from the `Semaphore`. That is, there is no guarantee that the first thread to call `acquire()` is also the first thread to obtain a permit. If the first thread is blocked waiting for a permit, then a second thread checking for a permit just as a permit is released, may actually obtain the permit ahead of thread 1.

If you want to enforce fairness, the `Semaphore` class has a constructor that takes a boolean telling if the semaphore should enforce fairness. Enforcing fairness comes at a performance / concurrency penalty, so don't enable it unless you need it.

Here is how to create a `Semaphore` in fair mode:

```
Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(1, true);
```
